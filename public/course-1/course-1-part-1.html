                    Part 1 introduces God's original plan to extend His kingdom on earth, the strategy
                    for rulership through spirit-led people, and the identity of sons, citizens, and ambassadors.

                <h2>The Original Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    God's intent was to establish a visible kingdom without appearing in the visible realm.
                    He chose to create a family of offspring to represent Him and execute His invisible kingdom
                    in the seen world.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Create offspring from His own Spirit.</li>
                    <li>Offspring would be like God and represent Him on earth.</li>
                    <li>They would establish and execute His kingdom in the seen world.</li>
                    <li>Religion is a man-made search; relationship ends the search.</li>
                    <li>God planned for sons, citizens, and ambassadors, not subjects.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="highlight">
                    Romans 8:14, Galatians 3:26, Matthew 5:9, Philippians 3:20, Ephesians 2:19,
                    2 Corinthians 5:20 emphasize sonship, citizenship, and ambassadorship.

            <section class="part-section">
                <h2>The Original Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    God chose to rule the seen realm from the unseen realm through the unseen spirit man
                    living in a seen body on earth. The spirit man communicates through the soul to carry
                    heaven's will into visible life.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Rule the seen world from the unseen heaven.</li>
                    <li>Deploy the unseen spirit man in a seen body.</li>
                    <li>Use spirit-to-spirit communication for kingdom direction.</li>
                    <li>Bring heaven's will into the visible world.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="part-section">
                <h2>Creator</h2>
                <p>
                    God is the creator and King of the kingdom. He owns the seen world but delegates rulership
                    to mankind. Dominion is part of human design, not domination by other forces.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Genesis 1:1 establishes God as creator of heaven and earth.</li>
                    <li>God sets standards, rules, and judges all things.</li>
                    <li>Earth is the domain where mankind rules on God's behalf.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="part-section">
                <h2>Rulership</h2>
                <p>
                    God granted rulership, not ownership. The dominion mandate is a management contract,
                    holding humanity accountable for stewarding the earth by God's standards.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The earth belongs to mankind as a stewardship (Psalm 115:14-16).</li>
                    <li>Heaven is God's domain; earth is humanity's assignment.</li>
                    <li>Rulership means accountability to the King's standards.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="part-section">
                <h2>Prayer</h2>
                <p>
                    Prayer authorizes heaven's resources to operate on earth. God can do anything, but He works
                    through the permission given by those with dominion on earth.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>"Without God, we cannot. Without us, God will not." - John Wesley.</li>
                    <li>Prayer is business with the unseen government.</li>
                    <li>We are to be a prayer people, not just attend meetings.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section class="part-section">
                <h2>The Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    The mission is to transform followers into leaders. Kingdom identity calls for leadership
                    through stewardship, mastery, and dominion in every domain.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Transforming followers into leaders and kings.</li>
                    <li>Identity rooted as sons of God and royal citizens.</li>
                    <li>Lead by taking responsibility for the earth.</li>
