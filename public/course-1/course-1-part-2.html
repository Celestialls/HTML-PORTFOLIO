                <h1>The Dominion Mandate of Leadership</h1>
                <p>
                    Part 2 explores the Bible as a kingdom manual, the meaning of dominion, and the
                    kingdom concept rooted in a righteous King who sets the standards for life.

                <h2>The Bible</h2>
                <p>
                    The Bible is a book about a kingdom. God never intended a republic or democracy. In a kingdom,
                    the King is not elected and cannot be voted out. Rebellion is the word used for sin.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Genesis 1:26 connects dominion to the image and likeness of God.</li>
                    <li>The King's standards define life for the kingdom.</li>
                    <li>Citizens maintain the standards established by God.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="highlight">
                    Matthew 24:14 and Matthew 13:44-46 show the kingdom as the message of Jesus and the treasure
                    worth everything.

            <section class="part-section">
                <h2>Dominion</h2>
                <p>
                    Dominion means to govern, rule, control, manage, master, and lead. It is a mandate for stewardship
                    rather than control for its own sake.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>To govern and rule by standards.</li>
                    <li>To manage as faithful stewards.</li>
                    <li>To master and lead with responsibility.</li>
                    <li>John 5:17-19 shows the Son modeling the Father's work.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="part-section">
                <h2>The Concept of Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    A kingdom is everything its king is. A great King makes a great kingdom. The kingdom concept
                    demands a King who is wise, generous, protective, and deeply loving toward citizens.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Goodhearted, wise, and knowledgeable King.</li>
                    <li>Mighty to protect and rich to provide.</li>
                    <li>Generous and rewarding to citizens.</li>
                    <li>God as King brings life and stability to the kingdom.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="highlight">
                    God speaks of the concept of nation in comparison to kingdom. Study how scripture compares
                    both terms to strengthen your understanding.
