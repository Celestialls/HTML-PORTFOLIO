                <p>
                    Part 3 contrasts the kingdom mindset with the systems of the world, calling for
                    repentance, identity renewal, and knowledge that drives light over darkness.

                <h2>Repent</h2>
                <p>
                    Repentance means to change your thinking. It is a reversal of the mind toward the kingdom
                    of heaven that is now near.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Matthew 4:17 calls for a new way of thinking.</li>
                    <li>Change the conditioning of the mind toward kingdom truth.</li>
                    <li>Repentance is not just sorrow, it is a transformed mindset.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="highlight">
                    "As a man thinks in his heart, so is he." The kingdom begins in the mind of God and is
                    released through renewed minds on earth.

                <h2>You Are the Kingdom</h2>
                <p>
                    The kingdom of God on earth is the functioning of rulers in their domain. You are designed
                    for dominion and leadership by the spirit within you.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Dominion means to govern, rule, control, manage, master, and lead.</li>
                    <li>Leadership is to be discovered within, not manufactured outside.</li>
                    <li>God calls people by who they are becoming, not their current label.</li>
                    <li>You are a deployee, not an employee, assigned to bring kingdom culture.</li>

                <h2>Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    Darkness is ignorance. The enemy uses ignorance to rule, but the word of God brings light
                    and knowledge that breaks the grip of darkness.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>The greatest power of the enemy is what you do not know.</li>
                    <li>The word of God is the light that destroys ignorance.</li>
                    <li>Study, read, and renew the mind to walk in light.</li>
                    <li>Romans 12:1-2 calls for transformation through renewed thinking.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="highlight">
                    The first thing God gave Adam to protect him was information. Knowledge is central to
                    kingdom leadership and spiritual authority.
